    <p>Due to the fleshy outgrowth on the upper half of its head and sides of its face, the oranda has become one of the most popular goldfish.The headgrowth is described as a "wen" by Chinese aquarists.</p>
    <p>The oranda is a metallic or matte scaled goldfish that is similar in appearance to the veiltail. It has a large, long and deep body accompanied by a long quadruple tail. This four-lobed and contracted tail normally spreads out broadly when the oranda stops swimming. The back does not rise up to form a ryukin-like hump.</p>
    <p>Orandas are available in a variety of colors, most often orange, red, red-and-white, red-and-black, black, blue, chocolate, bronze, white or silver, black-and-white (panda-colored), red-black-and-white (tricolor), and calico colors.</p>
    <p>The headgrowth of young fry may take one to two years to develop.The oranda can reach 20 to 31 centimeters (7.9 to 12.2 inches) in length.Sometimes the wen grows enormously, covering the eyes of the goldfish. Due to this, the fish may have only limited eyesight or even become blind. Special care should be given to the wen because it is prone to bacterial infections. The Oranda can tolerate temperatures from 17 to 28 °C (63 to 82 °F). More recently blue scale oranda have been developed but these fish are very rare.</p>
