			<h1>AWS-Cloud Computing</h1>
			<p>In 2006, <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b> started to offer IT services to the market in the form of web services, which is nowadays known as <b>cloud computing</b>. With this cloud, we need not plan for servers and other IT infrastructure which takes up much of time in advance. Instead, these services can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. we pay only for what we use with no up-front expenses and no long-term commitments, which makes AWS cost efficient. </p>
			<h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
			<p><b>Cloud computing</b> is an internet-based computing service in which large groups of remote services are networked to allow centralized data storage, and online access to computer services or resources.</p>
			<p>Using cloud computing, organizations can use shared computing amd storage resources rathet than building, operating, and improving infrastructure on their own.</p>
		<p>cloud computing is a model that enables the following features.</p>
		<p> Users can provision and release resources on-demand.</p>
		<p> Resources can be scaled up or down automatically, depending on the load.</p>
		<p> Resources are accessible over a network with proper security.</p>
		<p>Cloud service providers can enable a pay-as-you-go model, where customers are charged based on the types of resources and per usage.</p>
			<h3>Types of Clouds</h3>
		<p>There are three types of clouds - public, Private, and Hybrid cloud.</p>
		<h4>Public Cloud</h4>
		<p>In public cloud, the third-party service providers make resources and services available to their customers via Internet. Customer's data and related security is with the service provider's owned infrastructure.</p>
		<h4>Private Cloud</h4>
		<p>A private cloud also provides almost similar features as public cloud, but the data and services are managed by the organization or by the third party only for the customer's organization. In this type of cloud, major control is over the infrastructure so security related issues are minimized.</p>
